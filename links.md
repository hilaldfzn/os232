* [Virtual Memory: 7 Address Translation Example Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/6neHHkI0Z0o?si=b5yVYnKhNpNbLzyb) --- Virtual memory translation involves the conversion of virtual page numbers and offsets to their respective physical page numbers and offsets. This process ensures that programs can function as if there's a large, continuous memory space available, even if the physical memory is fragmented or limited. The page table is a key component in this system, maintaining a record of these mappings. These entries are stored on a storage device, like a disk. If a required page isn't readily available in the main memory, a page fault occurs. When this happens, the system retrieves the necessary page from the storage medium and loads it into memory, ensuring smooth operation.
